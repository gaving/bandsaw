0.9.1
  * Replaced the windows only virtual table
  * Added a title bar to the view so you can easily see the quick filter
  * The detail view is new a SashForm so it's parts can be resized

0.9.0
  * Improved preference
    - Added border to column list
    - Improved colum preference layout
    - Selection now stays on object through the up/down clicking
    - Moving the columns up or down now moves the size preference with it
  * Improved table reduction performance
    - Table clearing or filtering which resulted in shrinking the table
      size was horribly slow due to redraws.  Now the table is temporarily
      hid during this process to prevent the redraw activity from hanging
      the system on large tables.

  * Added color
  * Added fancier icons
  * Modified detail view/window

0.8.4

0.8.3
  * Added this changelog :)
  * Inverted order so latest message shows up on top
  * Added a display limit so I can curb the horrible performance until
    I can find a better table mechanism. [default = 50]
  * Compiled with 1.3 compatibility so it will work with jdk1.3
  * Added the "Throwable" column which will print out either nothing or
    "Exception" depending on whether or not there is any Throwable/Stack
    data available with the event
  
Known Bugs
